I'm an indie hacker building lean, useful products for the internet — with a focus on automation, simplicity, and speed.

### 🚀 What I’ve Built
- 🐝 [**PostHyve**](https://posthyve.com) – a modern alternative to Buffer & Hootsuite for scheduling social posts with ease.
- 🧱 [**IndieSaaS**](https://github.com/indieceo/indiesaas) – a production-ready **Next.js** SaaS boilerplate with authentication, Stripe integration, and more.

### 🛠 Tech I Work With
